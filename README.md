# dsc80-fa19-Snapchat-Ads
In class projects for DSC 80 Fall 2019.

Project 3: This project uses political ads data from popular social media app, Snapchat. Topics include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, missingness, and hypothesis testing to assess whether or not ads originating from the United States target older users compared to other countries.

Project 5: A continuation of the same data from project 3. Topics include prediction (regression), feature engineering, model performance, fairness, and bias to predict the amount of impressions an ad will receive.
